# ðŸ‘® Command

<b>Command</b> is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a requestâ€™s execution, and support undoable operations.

## Applicability

Use the Command pattern when you want to :

- parameterize objects by an actiontoperform, asMenultem objects did above.
  You can express such parameterization in a procedural language with a
  callback function, that is, a function that's registered somewhere to be called
  at a later point. Commands are an object-oriented replacement for callbacks.
- specify, queue, and execute requests at different times. A Command object
  can have a lifetime independent of the original request. If the receiver of a
  request can be represented in an address space-independent way, then you
  can transfer a command object for the request to a different process and fulfill
  the request there.
- support undo. TheCommand's Execute operation can store state for reversing its effects in the command itself. The Command interface must have an
  added Unexecute operation that reverses the effects of a previous call to Execute. Executed commands are stored in a history list. Unlimited-level undo
  and redo is achieved by traversing this list backwards and forwards calling
  Unexecute and Execute,respectively.
- support logging changes so that they can be reapplied in case of a system
  crash. By augmenting the Command interface with load and store operations, you can keep a persistent log of changes. Recovering from a crash
  involves reloading logged commands from disk and reexecuting them with
  the Execute operation.
- structure a system around high-level operations built on primitives operations. Such a structure is common in informationsystems that support transactions. A transaction encapsulates a set of changes to data. The Command
  pattern offers a way to model transactions. Commands have a common interface, letting you invoke all transactions the same way. The pattern also
  makes it easy to extend the system with new transactions.

## General structure

</p>

- Command : declares an interface for executing an operation.
- ConcreteCommand :
  - defines a binding between a Receiver object and an action.
  - implements Execute by invoking the corresponding operation(s) on Receiver.
- Client : creates a ConcreteCommand object and sets its receiver.
- Invoker : asks the command to carry out the request.
- Receiver : knows how to perform the operations associated with carrying out a request. Any class may serve as a Receiver.
