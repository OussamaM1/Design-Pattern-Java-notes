# ðŸ‘· Builder

<b>Builder</b> is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

## Applicability

We use the Builder pattern when

- The algorithm for creating a complex object should be independent of the
  parts that make up the object and how they're assembled.
- The construction process must allow different representations for the object
  that's constructed.
