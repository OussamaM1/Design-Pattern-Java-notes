## ðŸŒ¿ Composite

<b>Composite</b> is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.

## Applicablity

Use the Composite pattern when

- you want to represent part-whole hierarchies ofobjects.
- you want clients to be able to ignore the difference between compositionsof
  objects and individual objects.Clients will treat all objectsin the composite
  structure uniformly.

## General structure

<p align="center">
  <img src="../../images/composite.png" width="700" />
</p>

- Component :
  - declares the interface for objectsin the composition.
  - implements default behavior for the interface common to all classes, as
    appropriate.
  - declares an interface for accessing and managing its child components.
  - (optional) defines an interface for accessing a component's parent in the
    recursive structure, and implements it if that's appropriate.
- Leaf :
  - represents leaf objects in the composition. A leaf has no children.
  - defines behavior for primitive objects in the composition.
- Composite :
  - defines behavior for components having children.
  - stores child components.
  - implements child-related operations in the Component interface.
- Client :
  - manipulates objects in the composition through the Component interface.

## Example

Every organization is composed of employees. Each of the employees has the same features i.e. has a salary, has some responsibilities, may or may not report to someone, may or may not have some subordinates etc.

- Component : Employee
- Leaf : Developer & Designer
- Composite : Organization

The code source : [source folder](./src)

```Java
  public static void main(String []args){

        Employee developerOne = new Developer(100, "Developer one", "Back-end");
        Employee developerTwo = new Developer(101, "Developer two", "FullStack");
        Employee designerUI = new Designer(201, "Designer one", "UI designer");
        Organization organization = new Organization();
        organization.addEmployee(developerOne);
        organization.addEmployee(developerTwo);
        organization.addEmployee(designerUI);

        organization.showEmployeeDetails();

        // delete developer Two
        System.out.println("----------------------");
        organization.removeEmployee(developerTwo);

        organization.showEmployeeDetails();

  }

```

Output :

```
    100- Developer one Back-end
    101- Developer two FullStack
    201- Designer one UI designer
    ----------------------
    100- Developer one Back-end
    201- Designer one UI designer
```
